Note that each bitmap described above is one block wide. Following the inode bitmap
block is a sequence of blocks called the inode table which contains inodes as described
in the lecture. Each block contains inodes with the size of each inode specified as a
two-byte integer in byte offsets 88-89 of the superblock.
Each block group has its own set of inodes. The number of inodes in each block
group can be found in byte offsets 40-43 of the superblock.
inodes are distributed among block groups in sequence. Taking note that the first
inode number is 1 and with a hypothetical value of 100 inodes per block group, inodes
1-100 can be found in block group 0, inodes 101-200 are in block group 1, and so on and
so forth.
The inode itself may be found in memory by locating the starting address of the
inode table and taking the relative position of the inode in the block group as an index
into the inode table (e.g., since block group 1 has inodes 101-200 for the above example,
inode 101 is index 0 in the inode table of block group 1).
